    Home Sweet Home

    Gnoso is located in beautiful downtown of Greenville, SC &mdash; one of the best places in the world to live and work. Whether you're taking a run through Falls Park or eating at one of Greenville's renowned restaurants, its a place you won't quickly forget. Greenville is big enough to be fun but small enough to provide a sense of community and avoid the common pitfalls of larger cities; we think its the perfect place to call home.

    Our office is in the NEXT Innovation Center, an old warehouse that has been rennovated into a striking modern office complex complete with Wii rooms, translucent walls, high ceilings, and huge windows. Located right on the Reedy Reiver between Falls Park and Cleveland Park, we're a short walk from the parks, the Greenville Drive stadium and Main Street's West End.
